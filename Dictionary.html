                        <p class="p-style2">Interest is the monetary charge for the privilege of borrowing money. Interest expense or revenue is often expressed as a dollar amount, while the interest rate used to calculate interest is typically expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). Interest is the amount of money a lender or financial institution receives for lending out money.</p>

                        <p class="p-style2">When you buy a home you’ll typically put down a lump sum, called a ‘deposit’, towards the property’s purchase price. The remaining cost of your home can be paid for with a mortgage. You’ll own your home, but you must make monthly repayments on the mortgage to keep it.

                            Your regular mortgage payments will include interest. The amount of interest you pay depends on the mortgage interest rate – this is a percentage of the total amount you still owe.</p>

                        <h2 class="sub-heading-style1">Credit</h2>
                        <p class="p-style2">The word "credit" has many meanings in the financial world, but it most commonly refers to a contractual agreement in which a borrower receives a sum of money or something else of value and commits to repaying the lender at a later date, typically with interest.

                            Credit can also refer to the creditworthiness or credit history of an individual or a company—as in "she has good credit."</p>
